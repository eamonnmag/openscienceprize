# Everpub: reusable research, 21st century style

## Who we are

[Tim Head](https://betatim.github.io/) is a experimental particle
physicist currently working at [CERN](http://home.cern/). He is an
[active](https://github.com/betatim) open source developer focussing
on building better tools for reproducible science and
machine-learning.  Tim is an invited member of the inaugural 
[Open Leaders Cohort](https://www.mozillascience.org/wow-introducing-working-open-workshops-and-the-open-leaders-cohort)
of the [Mozilla Science Lab](https://www.mozillascience.org/about).

[Konrad Hinsen](http://dirac.cnrs-orleans.fr/~hinsen) is a
computational biophysicist at [CNRS](http://www.cnrs.fr/) with a
long-standing interest in reproducible research
(e.g. [ActivePapers](http://www.activepapers.org/)).  He was a
founding member of the Numerical Python team and is an author or
co-author of several Open Source scientific software packages. He is a
member of the editorial boards of
[Computing in Science & Engineering](https://www.computer.org/web/computingnow/cise)
magazine and of [ReScience](http://rescience.github.io/). He recently
published a book on
["Computation in Science"](http://computation-in-science.khinsen.net/).

[C. Titus Brown](https://impactstory.org/TitusBrown) is a genomics
and bioinformatics researcher at UC Davis who is also an active open
source developer and open science blogger.  Several of his publications
are highly reproducible already.

[Kyle Cranmer](http://theoryandpractice.org) is a physics professor
at NYU and co-lead of the open science and reproducibility working group
as part of the Moore-Sloan Data Science Environment at NYU, a PI for the
NSF-funded [DIANA-HEP](http://diana-hep.org) focusing on sustainable software, 
and founded the [Recast](https://github.com/recast-hep) project aimed at
making analysis of particle physics data analysis reproducible and reusable.

[Andrey Ustyuzhanin](https://github.com/anaderi) is the head of the interdisciplinary research group at Yandex School of Data Analysis ([YSDA](https://yandexdataschool.com)). His group is involved in data science-intensive research in fundamental science. YSDA is full member of [LHCb collaboration](http://lhcb.web.cern.ch/lhcb/), [SHiP collaboration](http://ship.web.cern.ch/ship/) and [CRAYFIS](http://crayfis.io). Interdisciplinary research success is highly sensitive to making research as much transparent for peers from domains involved as possible. Andrey is co-founder of [everware](http://everware.xyz) and [Reprodicuble Experiment Platform](https://github.com/yandex/rep) projects.

[Nicolas P. Rougier](http://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/) is a researcher in
computational neuroscience at the Neurodegerative Disease Institute (Bordeaux,
France). He is an active open source developer and has been confronted with the
[reproducibility problem](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fncom.2015.00030/full) in computational neuroscience. He co-founded the
[ReScience journal](http://rescience.github.io) with Konrad Hinsen.

[Lukas Heinrich](https://github.com/lukasheinrich) is a experimental particle
physicist involved in bringing reproducibility and reusability to the LHC experiments at CERN as
the lead developer of the [Recast](https://github.com/recast-hep) project.

Daniel Dobos is a experimental particle physicist working on the [ATLAS](http://www.atlas.ch) experiment at [CERN](http://www.cern.ch) as an expert for semiconductor silicon and diamond vertex detectors.
